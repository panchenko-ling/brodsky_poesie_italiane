Main file containing the full TEI XML code: brodsky_final_15-10-2025.xml.

The .csv files contain the datasets of places and persons, which were used for NER tagging, and the data on the preservation of rhyme in translations.

The tags_and_attributes.ipynb and tagging_loc_and_pers.ipynb files contain Python codes to demonstrate how the automatic tagging of places and persons and the aggregation of listPlace and listPerson was performed. Minor changes have been made both to the datasets and to the output of the code after performing it. For example, "city" tag was replaced by "settlement type="city"", and "type" and "role" tags for persons by the "trait" tag to match the TEI guidelines.

The tags_and_attributes.ipynb prints a full list of tags and attributes used in this TEI XML encoding. A detailed commentary on each used tag and attribute is provided in the Brodsky_tags&attributes.pdf.
